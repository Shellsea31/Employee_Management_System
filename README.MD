## Description
This week I was tasked to create an interface that makes it easy for users to interact with information stored in a database. I was challenged to build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. At a minimum my project should:

* Add departments, roles, and employees
* View departments, roles, and employees
* Update employee roles

I also included the console.table NPM package to view the data more efficiently.
